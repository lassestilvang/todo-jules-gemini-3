## 2024-05-24 - Hide Decorative Icons from Screen Readers
**Learning:** Added `aria-hidden="true"` to `lucide-react` icons (like Plus, Trash2, Check) used alongside descriptive text or within buttons containing `aria-label`s.
**Action:** When adding decorative icons to buttons or interactive elements, explicitly hide them using `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent screen readers from redundantly announcing the icon names.

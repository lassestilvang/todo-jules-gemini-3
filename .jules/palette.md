## 2026-05-04 - Decorative Icons Need ARIA Hidden
**Learning:** In this project's component architecture, Lucide icons placed next to descriptive text (like 'Add Label' or 'Delete') cause redundant screen reader announcements.
**Action:** Always add aria-hidden='true' to decorative Lucide icons when they are accompanied by visible descriptive text. Ensure icons conveying state (e.g., selection checkmarks) are not hidden without an accessible alternative.
